# PokemonTypes
This was my first computer science project in highschool and decided to remake it one evening in WPF. 
It's not advanced by any means but who knows maybe I'll add some features like more than 2 types, custom types, or importing pokemon from online to show what mon have the types selected. 
Designed so I can randomly think of 2 types, go "wonder what that would look like defensively?", and have an offline answer in seconds.
